# EC-Calendar
Project Aim:
You are required to design and develop an iPhone Application (App) to explain, promote, or
educate people to understand what EC-Calendar system is, so that people can realize the benefits
of it. EC-Calendar is a perennial calendar system that is much Easier than and Compatible with
the current Gregorian calendar system.
EC-Calendar has two editions. The 229 edition maintains the leap day on Feb 29 and it is 100%
compatible with the current calendar system. The 331 edition picks March 31 as the leap day and
it is 93.75% compatible with the current calendar system. You may pick either edition that you
like or include the explanation and promotion of both editions.
To complete the group project, you have to accomplish the following three tasks:

Task 1: App implementation (70 marks)
In this task, your group needs to make a workable app or at least a Minimum Viable Product
(aka MVP). MVP is a real app with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to
provide feedback for future product development. In task 2 (documentation), you may need to
define what functions to be contained in the MVP. There are some requirements of your app:
Basic requirements (40 marks):
• Functionalities
o Completeness of the whole business model mentioned in task 2
• User Interface Design
o Usable user interface
Advanced requirements (30 marks):
Marks will be given if one or more of the following advanced features are implemented. These
requirements may involve the techniques that you have learned in other courses:
• Functionalities
o Additional features that supports the proposed business model (more than a MVP)
• User Interface Design
o Nice app icon, color theme, and layout
o Accessible user interface
• Use of sensors
o Use more than one kind of sensors
• Internationalization and Localization
o Multiple languages and proper translation of text in different languages
• An iOS app written in Swift language using Xcode as IDE. You should zip the
code, and include it in the deliverable package.

A-, A, A+ Completed all the tasks, with
excellent outputs.
Implemented >1 advanced requirements
and it is functionable excellently.
